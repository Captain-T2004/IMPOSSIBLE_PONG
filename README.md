# IMPOSSIBLE_PONG
Just a game I made to learn unity and c#..............
This game was made to simulate a classic Atari Arcade Game "Pong".

It was a great learning experience where i learned to first use a lot of tools inside Unity that i can use in other projects.

It was fun and i hope you find it a little less "IMPOSSIBLE" than intended.
